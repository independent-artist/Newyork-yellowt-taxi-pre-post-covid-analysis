# Newyork-yellowt-taxi-pre-post-covid-analysis

Analysed the yellow taxi data of New York from the pre and post pandemic period i.e. analyse feb 2020 and June 2020 data and compare the changes in taxi market.

Problem Statement: Considering myself working as a data analyst in a company called Fast Cars. Fast Cars is a cab agglomerator like Uber and Ola i.e. it connects passengers to cabs in cities for travel through an app.

They are going to launch their product in New York City. But before they want to understand the new york taxi market.

As a data analyst I am provided with a Yellow Taxi dataset which contains information about taxis that people took in New York city from streets.

I was asked to analyse this data to provide insights about the taxi market of new york.

& a short and preliminary analysis on the data.

Find the data and the relevant information about Yellow Taxi dataset here - https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

Therefore, I worked with Taxi & Limousine Commissionâ€™s Yellow taxi dataset of  Feb 2020 (pre) & June 2020 (post) covid pandemic scenario.
(Data contains 18 columns & around Feb 6,200,000 rows | Jun 500,000 rows)

Cleaned data & applied missing data handling techniques using Pandas, followed by visualization using seaborn & matplotlib.

RESULT: Taxi booking is reduced by 92.06%, mostly the booking time is dropping after 6 PM in (June) post covid.
